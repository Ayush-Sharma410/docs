Quis autem vel eum iure reprehenderit qui in ea voluptate velit esse quam nihil molestiae consequatur, vel illum qui dolorem eum fugiat quo voluptas nulla pariatur?\"\n1914 translation by H. Rackham \"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?\"\nSection 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\", written by Cicero in 45 BC \"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat.\"\n1914 translation by H. Rackham \"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.\"\n   ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"  #td-cover-block-0 { background-image: …","ref":"/ko/about/","tags":"","title":"About SpaceOne"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/blog/","tags":"","title":"SpaceONEBlog"},{"body":"Product Overview Challenges  “83% of enterprise workloads will be in the Cloud By 2020” - Forbes.com     Challenges 1: Optimizing Cloud Expenses\nChallenges 2: Working with Multi Cloud Environments\nChallenges 3: Migrating Existing Applications onto the Cloud\nChallenges 4: Meeting Governing Compliance\nChallenges 5: Proprietary Lock-in\nHybrid \u0026 Multi Cloud Management   클라우드 환경에 표준화 된 운영 프로세스를 적용하여 체계적이고 안정적인 모니터링 서비스를 제공하며, 클라우드의 데이터를 안전하게 보호하고 리소스 분석을 통해 최적의 비용으로 인프라를 관리할 수 있도록 합니다.\n  엔터프라이즈 IT 환경은 기존 구축/투자된 Legacy 시스템과 Public/Private 클라우드가 혼합된 조합으로 엑세스 관리, 리소스 모니터링 및 서비스 최적화를 위한 중앙 집중식 통합 관리가 필요합니다.\n     \n  Enterprise-level Hybrid \u0026 Multi Cloud Management Platform\n  Data-driven\n  Single Source of Truth\n  Ease Expansion\n  Self-Service\n  Open Platform\n  vs.\n  Integrated Identity \u0026 Data-driven inventory management\n  Ease expansion to advanced services (Monitoring, Orchestration …)\n  Self-Service Portal\n  Open Platform for 3rd party integration\n    Architecture Key Features Converged Infra Management   체계화된 인프라 구성 정보 관리 시스템 (Inventory)\n  모든 인프라 구성 정보를 하나로 통합하여 신뢰성 있는 데이터 확보\n  인프라 정보를 자동으로 탐색하고 수집하여 정보의 최신성 유지\n  다양한 수집 정보를 반영할 수 있도록 유연한 데이터 베이스 제공(Flexible Scheme)\n    ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Product Overview Challenges  “83% of enterprise workloads will be in …","ref":"/docs/","tags":"","title":"Welcome to SpaceOne API"},{"body":"Welcome to the SpaceOne API Reference!
