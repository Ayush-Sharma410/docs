## Overview

As a means for user authentication, Cloudforet provides an authentication method using an account of other services using a plugin.   
For a list of authentication plugins currently supported by Cloudforet, see the **Plugin support list**.

You can use the **Google Oauth2** plugin,  
which authenticates users through your Google account, and the **Keycloak** plugin, which supports a single sign-on (SSO) via standard protocols.  
For more detailed settings, see the **Setup guide link** below
