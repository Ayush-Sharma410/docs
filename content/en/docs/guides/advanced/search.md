There are two ways to use the search bar from the data tables: advanced and keyword searches.

## Advanced search
The search field provided by SpaceONE makes data searches much more convenient.
All field names that can be searched would appear as you hover your mouse cursor over the search bar.

After selecting a field, you can manually enter a value for that field or choose it from a list of suggestions.

## Keyword search
Use the keyword search if you want to search all fields rather than limit your search to a specific field.
If you type the text in the search bar and press the enter key, the data containing the keyword is filtered in and displayed in the table.

You can use both advanced and keyword searches together, and multiple searches are possible.
The search word shall be displayed in the table if any of the field values ​​are matched by filtering the data with the "or" condition.
