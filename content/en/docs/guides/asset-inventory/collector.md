    Cloudforet gathers [Cloud resources](/docs/guides/asset-inventory) through a **Collector**, and its schedule can be set up.

## Overview

To collect data with a collector, you need two elements:

### Collector plugin

This is an element that defines the specifications of what resources to collect from the [Cloud provider](/docs/guides/asset-inventory), and how to display the collected data on the screen. 

Since each provider has a different structure and content of data, a collector completely relies on **Collector plugin** to collect resources.

For detailed information on this, see [here](/docs/guides/plugins/asset-inventory-collector).
 
### Service account 

To collect resources, you need to connect to an account on the [Cloud provider](/docs/guides/asset-inventory).

**Service Account** is your account information to link to your provider's account. 

A collector accesses the provider account through the service account created for each provider. 

For detailed information on this, see [here](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/service-account).

## Create a collector

(1) Click the [+ Create] button at the top left.

![collector-create-button](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector-img/collector-create-button_en.png)

(2) Follow the steps on the "Create New Collector" page.
(2-1) On the Plugin List page, find a required collector plugin and click the [Select] button.

![collector-plugin-lists](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector-img/collector-create-step1_en.png)

(2-2) Enter the name and version of the collector and click the [Continue] button.
(Depending on the collector, it can be required to select a specific cloud provider.)

![collector-plugin-create](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector-img/collector-create-step2_en.png)

{{<alert title="Version and auto upgrade">}}
Version refers to the version of the previously selected collector plugin, which can be chosen by disabling auto upgrade. In this case, the data is always collected with the specified version of the plugin.

On the other hand, if you enable auto upgrade, your data will always be collected with the latest version of the plugin.
{{</alert>}}

<br>

(2-3) Select additional options for the collector and click the [Continue] button.

(2-3-1) Service Account: Select either "All" or Specific Service Accounts. If you choose "All," the service accounts associated with the provider related to the collector will be automatically selected for data collection.

(2-3-2) Additional Options: Depending on the collector, there may or may not be additional options to select.

![collector-plugin-create](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector-img/collector-create-step3_en.png)

(2-4) You can set up a schedule to automatically perform data collection (optional).
Once you have completed all the steps, click the [Create New Collector] button to finalize the collector creation.

![collector-plugin-create](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector-img/collector-create-step4_en.png)

![collector-detail-delete](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector-img/collector-detail-name-delete_en.png)

<br>

## Set up automated data collection

After creating a collector, you can still modify the automated data collection schedule for each individual collector.

(1) In the collector list page, you can enable or disable automated data collection for each collector by using the schedule toggle button(Switch On/Off) in the collector card section. You can quickly set and modify the frequency by clicking the [Edit] button.  

![collector-edit-schedule](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector-img/collector-edit-schedule_01_en.png)

![collector-edit-schedule](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector-img/collector-edit-schedule_02_en.png)

(2) You can also navigate to the detailed page of each collector and change the schedule.

![collector-edit-schedule](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector-img/collector-detail-schedule_en.png)

<br>

## Start data collection immediately

You can collect data on a one-time basis without setting up automated data collection.

It allows data collection to take place even when the collector does not have an automated data collection schedule.

Data collection works in two ways:

- [Data collection for all attached service accounts](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector/#collect-data-for-all-attached-service-accounts)
- [Data collection for a single service account](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector/#collect-data-for-a-single-service-account)


### Collect data for all attached service accounts

Collector needs account information from a [Provider](/docs/guides/asset-inventory) for data collection, which is registered through [Service account](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/service-account).

(1) On the collector list page, move the mouse cursor over the collector card for which you want to collect data.

![collector-collect-data](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector-img/collector-edit-schedule_01_en.png)

(2) Whether or not the collector has completed a data collection can be checked in [Collector history](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector/#check-data-collection-history). You can click the [View details] link of a selected collector to go to that page.

<br>

### Collect data for a single service account

When collecting data with a collector, you may only collect data from a specific cloud providerâ€™s account.

(1) Select a collector from the collector list page, and go to detail page. 

(2) You can find the list of attached service accounts on the bottom of detail page. 

![collector-service-account](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector-img/collector-detail-service-account_en.png)

{{<alert title="Service account">}}
[Service account](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/service-account) has access information for the provider account required for data collection.

If no information can be found here, this means there is no account information for accessing the provider, and as a result, no data collection occurs even when the collector is running.

Therefore, to collect data with a collector, you must first register the account information of the provider in the [Service account] menu.

{{</alert>}}

(3) In order to start data collection, Click the [Collect Data] button on the right side of the service account for which you want to collect data.

<br>

## Checking data collection history

You can check your data collection history on the **Collector history** page.

You can go to the collector history page by clicking the [Collector history] button at the top of the collector page.

If you want to check only the data collection history of a specific collector, you can go to where you can check that information by clicking the [View details] button from a list of collectors.

![collector-history-at-table](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector-img/collector-history-at-table.png)

### Viewing data collection list

Through the chart at the top of the collector history page, you can quickly check data collection status by date.

The list at the bottom displays a list of data collections that meet the criteria for an advanced search and status filter. For a detailed description of advanced search, see [here](/docs/guides/advanced/search/).

For items in the process of data collection, you can check the collection status through the status bar of the job progress field.

![collector-history-full-page](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector-img/collector-history-full-page.png)

### Checking the details of data collection history

If you select a collection history from the list of data collections above, you will be taken to the collection history details page.

You can check data collection status, basic information, and **Collection history by service account**.

![collector-history-detail-full-page](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector-img/collector-history-detail-full-page.png)

#### Checking collection history for each service account

When you run the collector, each collection is performed for each associated service account.

Here you can find information about how the collection was performed by the service account.

{{<alert title="">}}
When collecting data, the collector accesses the cloud provider's account through the service account to get the data.
{{</alert>}}

![collector-history-detail-table](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/collector-img/collector-history-detail-table.png)

###### Key field Information
- Created Count: The number of newly added resources
- Updated Count: The number of imported resources
- Disconnected Count: The number of resources that were not fetched
- Deleted Count: Number of deleted resources (in case of a resource failing to fetch multiple times, it is considered deleted.)

#### Check the content of collection errors

(1) Select the item you want to check for error details from a list of collections for each account.

(2) You can check the details of errors in the [Error list] tab below.
