## Getting a list of server resources

You can check a list of server resources by entering the server page through the [Asset inventory > Server] menu.

[Advanced search](/docs/guides/advanced/search) allows you to filter the list by elaborate criteria.

Click the [Excel] icon button to [Export as an Excel file] for a list of resources (/ko/docs/guides/advanced/excel-export) or click the [Settings] icon button to [Personalize table fields](/ko/ docs/guides/advanced/custom-table).

## Opening the server resources console

Sometimes you need to work on a console site that a server resources provider offers.

(1) Select the server resource to which you want to connect the console.

(2) Click the [Console connection] button.

(3) Click the button to open the provider's console in a new tab where you can continue working with the server resource.

Below is an example of the AWS EC2 Instance console that was opened.

## Explore server resources

If you select the item you want to look at from a list of server resources, you can check information about the resource at the bottom.

It is equivalent to the [Explore cloud service resources](/docs/guides/asset-inventory/cloud-service/#resources-in-cloud-services) in the [Asset inventory > Cloud service] menu.
