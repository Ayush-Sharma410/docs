## Overview

In the hyper-competitive software market, design system have become a big part of a product’s success. So, we built our design system based on the principles below.

A design system increases collaboration and accelerates design and development cycles. Also, a design system is a single source of truth that helps us speak with one voice and vary our tone depending on the situational context.


## Principle

### User-centered

Design is the “touch point” for users to communicate with the product. Communication between a user and a product is the key activity for us. We prioritize accessibility, simplicity, and perceivability. We are enabling familiar interactions that make complex products simple and straightforward for users to use.

### Clarity

Users need to accomplish their complex tasks on our multi-cloud platform. We reduced the length of the thinking process by eliminating confusion for a better user experience. We aim to users achieve tasks simpler and improve motivation to solve tasks.

### Consistency

Language development is supported by a variety of sensory experiences. We aim to have the best and the most perfectly consistent design system and keep improving the design system by checking usability.
